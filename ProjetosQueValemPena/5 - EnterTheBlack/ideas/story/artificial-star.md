#### Background information:
For a superior alien race(of course long dead when the player enters the universe) it would be useful to disguise a structure, that should be hidden for doing classified research or surveillance operations without getting noticed by anyone, as a star.

For this it would be needed to keep a small layer of plasma(preferrably a helium-hydrogen mixture) around the structure at a constant temperature of few thousand Kelvin.

This needs a good power generation(most likely using nuclear fusion) and a good heat distribution and regulation system to prevent big differences in surface temperature.

Under normal conditions the player and no other alien race would be able to look through the disguise, but what if one of systems started producing errors after this long time like distributing most of the heat towards one side? (see image above)

#### Possible Player Experience:
1. Random event triggered: The player discovers a strange star by entering a system(the error appeared too recently to discover via satellite) or satellites on earth discover it over long distance.
2. Player takes some scientists there to investigate.
3. Scientists are unable to find a reason for this phenomenon and advise getting more data using a not yet manufactured probe that can withstand the heat on the colder side.
4. About 1Â±0.5 years later: A prototype of the probe is ready and needs to be carried by the player back to the star.
5. Probe finds out that the temperature doesn't rise while moving deeper into the star and discovers a huge artificial "wall" of an unknown metal.
6. The player can decide between a few options on how to go on:
 - blow it all up
 - build more probes(costs money this time) to find an entry if it exists (limited chance of success, takes time) and then open it(takes engineers and some time) and fly through.
 - forget about it(time might lead again stabilized surface temperature)
 - place a few smaller bombs on the hot side hoping to destroy the heating mechanism(chance to blow it all up, chance it stabilizes the surface temperature, chance it does nothing)
 - try to blow a hole in the metal and fly inside (smallest chance of success, some hull damage due to heat when flying inside)
 - ask a superior alien race for assistence(chance that race betrays the player, chance they assume it's fake or even worse think it's a trap(the latter decreases reputation), chance to increase reputation)

In all the time another alien race might decide to investigate the phenomenon(increasing chance over time). They might take over the system with military presence(they will attack the player after a warning). All the possible outcome of the players choice might happen.

Succeeding in entering the core will lead to technological advance for you or another alien race. If an alien race succeeds it will blow the star to prevent others from getting this technology.

If the surface returns to normal there will be no way for the player or another species to enter.

There is also a small chance that the "star" blows up without the player doing anything.

If the star blows the system will vanish. If it lies inside a sphere of influence of another species the player's reputation will drop.
