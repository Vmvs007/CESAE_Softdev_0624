java-shooter-game-project
=========================

A simple Java game project for programming class.

It is a very simple 2D shooter game, I tried to explain codes with commands in the source files.
It works but I had very limited time while I was writing that code, so there might be some bugs.
I tested it on Linux and Windows, it works better on Linux than Windows.
I used Inkscape (http://www.inkscape.org) for editing graphics and 
also I used some vector and icon sets, for detailed information please see credits.txt or click on Credits button when you run the code.

I hope that it is helpful for your own homeworks or projects.
Please put a link on somewhere to my github page, if you use the codes with no changes.

You can see project description which is here,


You are expected to implement a simple shooter game with the following scenario:
	_Alien creatures from another dimension are attacking people all over the world and you are
the last defender of human race. Your home is your castle and you have to defend this castle.
These creatures came from an inter-dimension portal whose one end is in your house garden. The
creatures appear from the portal. You have a cannon located in your house and you are shooting
those creatures. You can move your cannon up and down. Each creature has got different strength
which reflect on the scores if you destroy them._


__Minimum Criteria:__

You are expected to design the game by using java. Below are the minimal criteria:

* Proper object oriented (OO) hierarchy (E.g. Creatures, cannon types can be implemented
that way. Use concepts of interfaces, abstract classes while designing OO hierarchy)
* Mouse or Key listeners (at least one of them to control your gun)
* Minimal GUI elements ( Minimal a button, a check box and a text field)
* Graphics (Java 2D API usage while designing your graphical elements)
* Animation (Creatures must move or when they die, there can be some animation)
* Create a jar file
* High Score (Keep user high scores for only recent games. Show it in a GUI element, e.g. list
box. You do NOT have to save it on disk and load it.)


These are the __minimum__ criteria, you can use more than these. Your application should work
without any errors, so donâ€™t forget to run and check your application.


__Limitation:__

You __cannot__ use third party libraries in your project.
